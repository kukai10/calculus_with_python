    euler's method to approximate first order differential equation
    conditions to use this function:
        1.) the function must behave well (continuous, linear)
        2.) y' = F(x, y)
        3.) initial value and the slope at that point is known

    Explanation:
        initial_value is the starting point
        t0 is the inital time
        h is the step interval, approximation gets better as h gets smaller
